# Wear Crash Reporter

Reports crashes on the watch app into the phone app's crash report system.

Works with any [third party] crash reporter installed on the Phone app.

We install a crash handler on the watch Virtual Machine, when a crash is caught, its trace and type are serialized to json, 
saved to the FileSystem, then sent with a service as a MessageApi Message. Upon reception by a WearableListenerService in 
the phone app it is deserialized and passed to the installed Phone Virtual Machine's crash reporter.

The top of the stack trace then looks like:

Thread [#] â€” WearableListenerService

in the crash report
